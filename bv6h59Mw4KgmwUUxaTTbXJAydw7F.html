What are the statistics?</span></h2><p><span>— It depends on the sexual Constitution — it determines the potential of a person and the age when a man begins to have problems. First of all, it is affected by the innate level of testosterone and metabolism. We distinguish three levels: strong, medium and weak.</span></p><p><span>If the sexual Constitution is low, then problems can appear quite early — after 35. Such men, in principle, are not very prone to sexual life, they often have a reduced desire, life tone is not so high, and ambition is lower. In men with an average sexual Constitution this is close to 50-55 years, in men with a strong sexual Constitution-to 60. Although the difficulties may appear earlier.</span></p><h2><span>Is the test taken for the level of testosterone?</span></h2><p><span>— Not exactly. Testosterone is more important during puberty: if the level of testosterone is very low at this point of course, often even feminization occurs. For example, eunuchs (boys who were castrated before puberty) grew up outwardly effeminate.</span></p><p><span>And if the level of testosterone in a teenager is normal, then it does not matter further. The sexual Constitution is an innate level testosterone's. The one that was at the time of birth and depends on the parents. This is exactly the same for women.</span></p><h2><span>What causes mostly lead to sexual problems in men?</span></h2><p><span>— Let's start with the fact that one of the most common reasons for giving up your sex life is the appearance of sexual desire. a man has certain problems in sex.</span></p><p><span>Let's say that the problem with the appearance of an erection: it appears worse or has become unstable. A man is worried about this, but instead of going to a specialist and solving the problem, he begins to avoid sex and at a fairly early age can stop sex life. Goes to work, Hobbies, watching TV.</span></p><p><span>The woman, of course, goes through some time (women do not have such problems with age: although there may be a lack of lubrication, but physiologically a woman can have sex for the rest of her life), but then she gets tired of being rejected, and so does she she forgets about her sex life.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Instead of solving the problem, people sometimes start avoiding sex.</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Another frequent problem is related to control of ejaculation, i.e. there is either accelerated ejaculation, or difficult (when the man can not finish: the erection disappears earlier).</span></p><p><span>There may also be a decrease in desire and a weakening of sexual function on the background of somatic diseases, or inflammatory processes, or chronic fatigue, or other factors.</span></p><p><span>There may be a conflict situation with the spouse, or the partner ceases to be for the man sexually attractive.</span></p><p><span>Another problem that is more common in young men is Masturbation.</span></p><p><span>For example, the wife is pregnant, and there are restrictions in sex, or there was a conflict in the couple, and infidelity contradicts the principles of a man — and he begins to watch pornography and masturbate. Slowly this replaces the usual contact, and over time sex becomes unnecessary, because orgasm during Masturbation is less energy-consuming.</span></p><p><span>Now there are a lot of visual stimuli, and the problem of Masturbation is quite serious. The body begins to block sex, and it is absolutely healthy a man may find that he does not have a strong desire to have ordinary sex with a woman.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Orgasm during Masturbation is less energy-consuming, and it begins to block sex.</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Perhaps the Central question concerns the methods of treatment. For example, for any the most severe blow will be such a diagnosis. like impotence. How is it treatable in principle?</span></h2><p><span>— First, you need to go to a competent urologist: is there any organic changes — inflammatory processes, blood flow disorders, microcirculation, etc. But if there are no changes, it means that this is the problem is functional.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, now widely distributed drugs that stimulate an erection. And many men, instead of solving the problem, start using these drugs (many are sold without a prescription). With the drug, a man does everything right, but the problem is hesitate.</span></p><p><span>In fact, in addition to medication, there are other highly effective methods of therapy: special exercises, physiotherapy procedures, massages, and a special method of solving many sexual problems is also used - LOD therapy (local negative pressure).</span></p><p><span>This massage of the penis with the help of a vacuum, which allows you to restore an erection, improve blood flow in the genital area, microcirculation in the pelvis, normalize ejaculation, etc.</span></p><p><span>At the same time, age does not matter: there are patients who are over 80, and they live a sexual life. For today day — I can state this authoritatively — there are no erectile disorders that cannot be cured.</span></p><h2><span>At what point can we talk about problems with potency? Everyone has a moment of fatigue, stress. When is it time to start worrying about your health?</span></h2><p><span>— When more than 50% they become unsuccessful (the literature writes differently: someone believes that at least 30%). And if this problem is repetitive, regular. In principle, one-time failures occur in men regardless of age: fatigue, other factors-physiological, psychological.</span></p><h2><span>You have already said that the level of sexual desire depends on the sexual Constitution. Is there any dependence on age, or is everything strictly individual? Can we say, for example, that in 20 years there should be a desire every day, in 30 — once a week?</span></h2><p><span>— No. Everything depends on the sexual Constitution. There are young people, who have a desire very rarely, and men over 70 who want it every day. But there is a certain frequency of sex, recommended for a healthy man (if there is no severe stress and pathologies) — 1 time in 10-14 days.</span></p><p><span>It is clear that there are refusals of sexual life — for religious and other reasons — but if you abstain for more than two weeks, changes in blood flow, microcirculation, hormonal background suffers, etc. And from the point of view of maintaining good relationships in the family, it is desirable that contact occurs once a week — in such couples, less often occurs disharmony.</span></p><p><span>In General, if everything is physiologically good, the conditional recommended rhythm is 2-3 times a week. This is the" average temperature " in the world, and there are, of course, a lot of individual nuances.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>There are men over 70 who want it every day. It all depends on sexual Constitution.</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>The next question is about relationships: can you give advice to women? Let's say that the husband has failed to have sex several times in a row, and then darkly deviates, and the woman realizes that he has health problems. But it's hard to talk about it. How to start a dialog with the husband, so as not to hurt him even more, because it is already difficult for him, so as not to offend, but at the same time solve the problem?</span></h2><p><span>— There are two extremes. The first is when a woman wants to take revenge or hurt a man and directly calls him impotent. The second is when she pretends nothing not occur.</span></p><p><span>In such situations, the man usually answers my question, how does the wife react to the problem: "She doesn't care if I have an erection or not." And when I communicate with a woman, it turns out that she is very worried, but is silent, because she is afraid of offending.</span></p><p><span>Optimal option — when the woman speaks: "We have started having problems, and they are our common problems. Let's solve this issue together, because it is important to me that we have good sex." In fact, this is a pair function. If it is very difficult to start a discussion, I sometimes suggest writing a letter.</span></p><h2><span>Who comes more often to a sexologist-are men alone or together with their wife?</span></h2><p><span>— When such a problem occurs, a man often goes to a urologist. As a rule, they come to me when urologists can not understand the situation or prescribe medications, and the man does not want to take pills.</span></p><p><span>I recommend that you come together with his wife, but more often the man comes alone. We invite a partner if I want to clarify a certain situation or when there are interpersonal problems. But even if they come in pairs, we communicate separately with each of them.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Sex is a paired function. And decide the problem must be solved together.</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>I understand that everything is individual, but on average, how long can a person expect to receive treatment?</span></h2><p><span>— From one and a half to three months. But they rarely come to me with severe organic problems that sometimes require surgical treatment.</span></p><h2><span>What can it do what if you run </span><span></span><a>men's health</a><span>, ignore the problems?</span></h2><p><span>— It's just that the function fades out gradually if it's not being used.</span></p><h2><span>And if you haven't had sex for 15 years, can you then restore the function?</span></h2><p><span>— May. There are cases when sexual life has stopped — there is no spouse, for example — and then a woman appears who is sexually active, and we restore our function, even without medications. It happened that the patient and 10 years passed without sexual life. But the longer the period of abstinence and the older the man, the harder it is recover.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>You can restore sexual health at any age.</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Can you briefly formulate as a summary: what does a man need for sexual health at any age?</span></h2><p><span>— Need a relationship with a woman who causes he has a desire, and regular, high-quality sex, since sexual function is paired and depends on both partners.</span></p><p><span>Well, if there are any problems, then you need to solve them: the sooner, the more effective. And, of course, to deal with prevention, since there have long been special methods that they allow a man to maintain sexual function for many years.</span></p><p><span><b>Read also:</b></span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h2><span></span><a>Why do we choose the wrong partners?
